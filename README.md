# School District Analysis: Data Analysis with Python
A classwork example project analyzing standardized test data using Python
## Overview
In this project, I assist "the chief data scientist" for a city school district. We prepared all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights will promote discussions and decisions at the school and district level.

Using Python, I extracted data from a csv file to create reports and visualizations.

## Summary
### Math and Reading Scores
While Charter schools and Public schools score very closely on average in reading,

Public schools score significantly lower in math on average.

Upperclassmen (11th and 12th graders) are, on average, scoring lower than the full school averages for reading and math.
